## The Three Layers of Intelligence

### 1. The Analyst 📉
Instantly scans your CSV for missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues. Features **Type-Aware Smart Sorting** (Currency/Dates) and **Disciplined Smart Split** (Address/Name) with categorical filtering.

### 2. The Brain 🧠
Uses client-side Machine Learning to find semantic patterns, grouping variations like "Google" and "Google Inc" automatically using `transformers.js`.

### 3. The Assistant 💬
Talk to your data naturally. "Ask Wozny" uses an embedded LLM (`@mlc-ai/web-llm`) to filter, search, and reason about your information.
